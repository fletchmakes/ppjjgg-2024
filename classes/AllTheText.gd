	#journal (closed)
	"It takes too long to write long-form by hand, so your journal usually houses indecipherable notes and ink or pencil doodles.", #7
	
	#water bottle (plain)
	"I’ve had this water bottle for a few weeks now, and I still haven’t decorated it yet. The stickers I wanted to use are on my desk somewhere. Ah, might as well do this while I’m thinking about it.", #8

	#phone
	"ask Fable to add flavour text for clicking on the phone before epilogue stuff", #10
	
	#stickynotes
	"Then, peeking from the bin below your desk, a crumpled page catches your eye. A poem lies unfinished, written in four skewed lines, hurried scrawl, and two-toned ink as if the first pen had dried mid-stroke.", #11
	"“I am as much able to direct my focus
as a leaf can direct the wind
flitting, flying, fluttering away
*where the heck is my other sock*”", #12
	
"The last line has three deep strikes across the letters, crossed out and forgotten. You glance down, and sure enough, your left foot is bare, while the other wears a sock with a monstera pattern.", #13
	
	#bin with paper
	"this is the bin", #14
	
	#sticker sheet
	"You find a sheet of stickers hidden beneath the mess of sticky notes strewn across your desk. The colours and designs are bright and cheerful, tiny paper stars with cute hand-drawn faces surrounding short phrases like “Be kind to yourself,” “Water your plants!” and “Hydrate or Diedrate.”", #15

	#journal (open)
	"The first page holds a short list of “Things to Prepare” surrounded by absent-minded doodles of rainbow coloured socks. From the top, the list reads: don’t forget ur water bottle, pack a snack, might rain… umbrella?,	special camera for the sparklies, phone, this notebook, socks.", #46
	
	#stickersheet pt 2
	"One that makes you giggle reads “Take ur meds, ya ding dong.”", #47
	
	#game intro
	"The sharp beep of an automobile outside jostles your brain from its attempt at dreams. Stiffness in your back and neck settle into an ache, and the realisation that parts of your body are quite numb pushes you to your feet. Maybe falling asleep on the floor wasn’t the best idea.", #48
	"You stretch, a yawn pulling your mouth wide, and look around your bedroom. Your brain itches with the thought that you’ve misplaced your plans for today, and what’s worse is that there are no immediate clues to what those plans were within sight.", #49
	"“A cork-board would be useful right about now. I made a mental note last night, but I always seem to misplace those. I need to stab these thoughts while they’re within reach.”", #50
	
	#sticky notes first line
	"Your desk and several sticky notes might be a good place to start, as you see multiple rows of handwriting scribbled across the small pages. But each one holds a poem, and while you at least remember when you wrote those, they don’t ring the right bells.", #51
	
	#smol plant
	"My best friend gave this to me when I moved in. She didn’t think it would last this long, and honestly, neither did I.", #52
	"I don’t think I have the energy to walk over to the bathroom right now, but there’s some water in my water bottle I can share with this little guy.", #53
	#smol plant w water bottle acquired
	"You tip a small stream of water into the pot, taking care to avoid splashing any on the plant itself. Your best friend knew how much this species of plant fascinates you, and plants in general.", #54
	"Though the last few years brought on a heavy cloud of loneliness and isolation, every time your plant started doing something strange, you dug into learning how to care for it.", #55
	"Most recently, stars and outer space have caught your attention. Last week, you spent an entire day sorting through boxes in your apartment’s basement storage unit to find the sticky wall stars from your early college days.", #56
	"Fond memories flood your brain with a boost of energy. Maybe there’s still some memorabilia from those years somewhere around here.", #57
	
	#smol plant pt 1 because I didn't allocate enough lines before checking :D
	"But, it’s still alive, and keeping it watered has given me something to get me out of bed on days when I really need the extra motivation. Kinda like what caring for a dog is for some people, but without the loud barking or expensive kibble.", #58
	
	#water bottle (applying stickers)
	"Really love how that turned out! I have a few stickers left that I can share with my friends next time we meet up. Wasn’t that supposed to be sometime soon? I should probably follow up with them sometime, maybe tomorrow. I have to remember this thing first, before I can do anything else.", #59
	
	#water bottle pickup
	"I could use some of this water for something.", #60
	
	#smol plant w water bottle acquired (middle passage, ran out of room in dialogue box
	"If there’s one thing you know you’re good at even if you get distracted on occasion, it’s researching things that interest you. At one point, you even bought a set of cute, illustrated cards to help you remember important plant facts.", #61
	
	#phone ringing + pamphlet
	"A soft jingle pulls your gaze towards your phone. The caller ID reads Plant Mom Em, and it’s exactly that moment when you remember. The bell finally rings.", #62
	"Oh! I know I just had it this morning. Where is that thing, is it in the drawer?", #63
	
	"“Paper Stars – The M Gray Library’s Autumn Origami Event”

Calling all creative and crafty creatures!", #64
	"Our lovely Library Director is hosting a monthly origami class, and on June 25th, they’ll be guiding us through the cosmos with a tutorial on origami paper stars. Feel free to bring your own materials, but we will also have supplies available during the class.", #65
	"Registration closes on June 17th. Everyone is welcome!", #66
	
	"Pamphlet in hand, you answer the phone, and somehow you’re breathless from the laughter building up in your chest.", #67
	"Emery, oh my god! I just remembered. When does the class start again? Yeah, I’ll meet you there. I’m getting on my shoes now. See you soon!!", #68
	
	#epilogue
	"After ending the phone call, you stretch, take a deep breath, and wiggle your body to shake off the brain fog. That impromptu nap might’ve been exactly what you needed as now you feel ready to venture outside of your apartment to spend time with your friends.", #69
	"I know it’ll probably take a lot of energy and I might need 14 hours of sleep tonight, but I’m excited to learn something new today.", #70
	"Some days, the AD is in HD, and that’s okay. It’s valid to take a break and start again tomorrow. Making sure I am kind and patient with myself can take work, but it’s worth it, because I deserve it.", #71
